    <p>[Verse 1]<br>
        I'm scared (Oh-oh-oh)<br>
        It feels like you don't care (Ooh-ooh)<br>
        Enlighten me, my dear (Ooh-ooh-ooh)<br>
        Why am I still here? Mm (Oh-oh)<br>
        I don't mean to be<br>
        Complacent with the decisions you made<br>
        But why? Mm <br>
        <br>
        [Pre-Chorus]<br>
        In the back of my mind<br>
        You died<br>
        And I didn't even cry<br>
        No, not a single tear<br>
        And I'm sick of waiting patiently<br>
        For someone that won't even arrive<br>
        [Interlude]<br>
        Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh<br>
        [Outro]<br>
        In the back of my mind<br>
        I killed you<br>
        And I didn't even regret it<br>
        I can't believe I said it<br>
        But it's true<br>
        I hate you</p>
